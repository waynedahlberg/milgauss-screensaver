# Clock.saver

This is a macOS screensaver inspired by the [Rolex Milgauss](https://www.rolex.com/watches/milgauss/m116400gv-0001.html) line of professional watches.

Thank you to Sam Soffes (@soffes) for his library, 'Clock.saver' on Github!

## Installation

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/soffes/clock-saver/releases).** Unzip and double-click.

Alternatively, if you're using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), you can run:
```
$ brew cask install clocksaver
```


## Preferences

Don’t forget to check out “Screen Saver Options…” in System Preferences. You can change the model and style to your liking.


## Building

Xcode 9.3b4 is required since Clock.saver is written in Swift 4.1.
